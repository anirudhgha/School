Using stock market data for 104 companies, this program will predict a company's stock x minutes into the future at any
given time.

The most difficult part of the project will be pre-processing the input data. The data must be split such that finally
there is x_train, x_test, y_train, and y_test. I will use my own data.

Based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) in Keras.
